        <li>Notwithstanding the security measures we take, it is important to remember that the transmission of data via the internet may not be completely secure and that you are advised to take suitable precautions when transmitting data via the Internet to us.</li>
      </ol>

      <h4>How Do We Share/Disclose Your Information</h4>
      <p>The policies and practices for sharing and/or disclosure of customer data to third parties is determined by the customer. Vidqu AI has no control over the customer's or any other third parties' choice to share and/or disclose customer data. Vidqu AI may share and disclose customer data in accordance with a Customer's instructions, including any applicable terms.</p>
      <p>Vidqu AI does not share or disclose your personal information to any third parties with four exceptions as below:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Our service providers.</strong> We will share your information with affiliated and unaffiliated service providers which assist us in carrying out the processing activities described in this Privacy Policy. Our service providers include payment processing providers, IT service providers, our auditors, and our legal, accounting and other professional advisors.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-party services.</strong> We may use other companies’ services to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulators, law enforcement, public or government authorities, or courts.</strong>  We will share your information if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with applicable law; (ii) comply with a valid legal request or respond to claims against Vidqu AI; (iii) respond to a valid legal request relating to a criminal investigation to address alleged or suspected illegal activity, or to respond to or address any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our Users to legal or regulatory liability; (iv) enforce and administer our Terms of Service; (v) respond to requests for or in connection with current or prospective legal claims or legal proceedings concerning Vidqu AI and/or third parties; or (vi) protect the rights, property or personal safety of Vidqu AI, our employees, our Users, or members of the public. </li>
        <li><strong>During a change to Vidqu AI’s business.</strong> If Vidqu AI undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganisation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer, or share some or all of our assets, including your Personal Information, in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction, such as due diligence. </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h4>Data Security and Confidentiality</h4>
      <p>Security is integral to Vidqu AI’s core principles of Control, Consent, and Collaboration and so we take it seriously. Vidqu AI has put in place suitable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard and secure personal information collected through our Services (actually no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure). If you become aware of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are requested to contact us immediately. We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as required.</p>
      <p>In addition, it is extremely important that you understand that it is your responsibility to protect the security of your password for the account registered for Vidqu AI Services. The password should be strong and unique and not easy to be guessed. It should be known by you only. It is equally important that you keep a copy in a safe place for your own reference because you will need your password to decrypt all the data you saved in our Services. We are unable to decrypt your data.</p>

      <h4>International Data Transfers</h4>
      <p>Vidqu AI has an international corporate presence, and our collection of Personal Information involves the transmission of data on a global basis. Information we collect may be transferred to recipients outside of the EEA, Switzerland and the UK for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you are based in the EEA, Switzerland or the UK and your Personal Data is transferred to a third country, that third country may not offer the same level of data protection as your home country. However, we transfer Personal Data pursuant to applicable data protection laws. To transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the UK, we rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions on certain countries and, for other jurisdictions, we rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission and any applicable country addenda. </p>
      <p>Cross-border transfers of Personal Information are carried out in accordance with the lawful bases outlined under applicable data protection laws, including the performance of a contract, the legitimate interests of Vidqu AI, or based on your explicit consent.</p>
      <p>The collected Personal Information may be transferred to recipients outside the EU, where data protection laws may not provide the same level of protection. However, Vidqu AI ensures that all transfers are secured by appropriate safeguards and that your Personal Information is protected against unauthorized access, loss, or destruction, unlawful processing and any processing which is inconsistent with the purposes set out in this privacy policy.</p>
      <p>Users maintain their rights to access, rectify, and erase their Personal Information, even when it is transferred internationally. If you wish to exercise any of these rights or require more information about our data transfer mechanisms, please contact us at support@vidqu.ai.</p>
      <p>By using our Services, you understand and acknowledge that your Personal Data will be processed and stored in our facilities and servers in the United States and may be disclosed to our service providers and affiliates in other jurisdictions.</p>
      
      <h4>User’s Rights</h4>

        <li>Object to the processing of your Personal Information in certain circumstances.</li>

      </ol>
      <p><strong>Note:</strong> Where we stop processing Personal Information or delete your Personal Information, it will possibly mean that you are unable to continue using our Services, and all your UGC will be permanantly removed, and you will be notified accordingly.</p>
            
      <h4>Information Warranty Disclaimer</h4>
      <p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, we are not responsible for the accuracy, correctness, and security of any of the information we gather, store, and disclose to you or to anyone else.</p>
      <p>Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you.
