        <h4>Our Intellectual Property</h4>
        <p>The Services contain intellectual property owned by Vidqu AI and/or our Representatives, including, without limitation, trademarks, copyrights, proprietary information, and other intellectual property as well as the Vidqu AI.com name, logo, all designs, text, graphics, other files, and the selection and arrangement thereof, also referred to as the "look and feel." The entirety of the Services is protected by intellectual property law, including international copyright and trademark laws. You are prohibited from modifying, publishing, transmitting, participating in the transfer or sale of, creating derivative works from, distributing, displaying, reproducing or performing, or in any way exploiting in any format whatsoever any of the Services or intellectual property, in whole or in part without our prior written consent, including, without limitation, any and all text, graphics, code, software, video, audio on the Services. We reserve the right to immediately remove you from the Services without notice or refund, or restrict you from access to the Services if you violate this term.</p>
        
        <h4>Payment</h4>
        <p><strong>Billing.</strong> If you purchase any Services, you will provide complete and accurate billing information, including a valid payment method. For paid subscriptions, we will automatically charge your payment method on each agreed-upon periodic renewal until you cancel. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll charge tax when required. If your payment cannot be completed, we may downgrade your account or suspend your access to our Services until payment is received. You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Payments; and (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct, and complete. We may employ the use of third-party services for the purpose of facilitating Payment. By submitting your Payment information, you understand that we may share that information with these third parties subject to our Privacy Policy.</p>
        <p><strong>Changes.</strong> We may change our prices from time to time. If we increase our subscription prices, we will give you at least 7 days’ notice and any price increase will take effect on your next renewal so that you can cancel if you do not agree to the price increase.</p>
        <p><strong>Cancellation & Refund.</strong> You can cancel your paid subscription at any time in your Vidqu AI account. Payments are non-refundable, except where required by law. These Terms do not override any mandatory local laws regarding your cancellation rights. To request a refund (or partial refund), please contact us by using the in-app feedback or email us at support@vidqu.ai. We will issue any refund to the payment method used for the Payment once it's approved. Refunds do not apply to Enterprise agreements. </p>

        <h4>Confidentiality</h4>
        <p>You may receive access to Confidential Information of Vidqu AI and other third parties through your use of the Services. You may use Confidential Information only as needed to access or use the Services pursuant to the Terms. You will protect such Confidential Information with reasonable care in a manner at least as protective as you use for your own Confidential Information. If you are required by law or court order to disclose such Confidential Information, you will give reasonable prior written notice to Vidqu AI and undertake reasonable efforts to limit the sharing of Confidential Information, including assisting HeyGen with challenging such a request if possible.</p>
        <p>Information should be treated as “Confidential Information” if it is designated as such by Vidqu AI or the third party owner or if it should reasonably be considered confidential under the circumstances. When in doubt, information should be treated as Confidential Information.</p>
