		</ol>
		<h5>To improve our application and service</h5>

		<h5>To improve customer service</h5>
		<p>Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your customer service requests and support needs.</p>
		<h5>To process transactions</h5>
		<p>Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested. With your permission and/or where permitted by law, we may also use your data for marketing purposes, including contacting you by email with news and offers about our products and services.</p>
		<h4>How and Where Do We Store Your Data?</h4>
		<p>We only keep your data for as long as we need to use it in accordance with the rules and/or for as long as we have your permission to keep it. In any event, we will conduct a review when appropriate to ascertain whether we need to keep your data. Your data will be deleted if we no longer need it by the terms of our Data Retention Policy.</p>

			<li>2. Data security is of great importance to us, and to protect your data, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the data collected through our site.</li>
			<li>3. Notwithstanding the security measures we take, it is important to remember that the transmission of data via the internet may not be completely secure and that you are advised to take suitable precautions when transmitting data via the Internet to us.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>How We Share Your Information</h4>
		<p>Vidqu FaceSwap does not share or disclose your personal information to any third parties with two exceptions as below:</p>
		<h5>Third-Party Service Providers</h5>
		<p>We may hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those companies will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.</p>
		<h5>Legal Requirements</h5>
		<p>In the event we are served with valid subpoenas, warrants, or other legal documents (for example, documents concerning the sale of all or part of our business), or where applicable law compels us to comply, or when we are required to defend the rights or property of the Vidqu AI Inc., including the security of our products and services, and the personal safety, property, or other rights of our customers and employees, or a request for data with the purpose of identifying and/or preventing credit card fraud, we may share your personal data as collected above.</p>
		<h5>The Use of Our Application</h5>
		<p>We may compile statistics about the use of our Application, including data on traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales, and other information. All such data will be anonymized and will not include any personally identifying information.</p>
		<h4>Security and Confidentiality</h4>
		<p>We understand and accept our responsibility to protect your data. Our employees are subject to confidentiality obligations. We use industry-standard information, security tools, and measures, as well as internal procedures and strict guidelines to prevent information misuse and data leakage, but we cannot guarantee that our systems will be absolutely safe (actually no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure). If you become aware of any potential data breach or security vulnerability, you are requested to contact us immediately. We will use all measures to investigate the incident, including preventive measures, as required.</p>
		<p>In addition, it is extremely important that you understand that it is your responsibility to protect the security of your password for the account registered for Vidqu FaceSwap Services. The password should be strong and unique and not easy to be guessed. It should be known by you only. It is equally important that you keep a copy in a safe place for your own reference because you will need your password to decrypt all the data you saved in our Services. We are unable to decrypt your data.</p>
		<h4>How to Access, Control, and Delete Your Data</h4>
		<p>You can add, remove, edit, and change any data that are saved in Vidqu FaceSwap Services, at any time, by logging into your account.</p>
		<p>You also have the right to deactivate and delete your Vidqu FaceSwap account at any time by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@vidqu.ai">support@vidqu.ai</a>. However, some information may remain in archived/backup copies to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.</p>
		<p>For the information processed by the third party partners, you have the right to access your personal information. If you want to access, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate data on our third party partner's platform, you should contact them directly as they are the data controllers and Vidqu FaceSwap has no control of those information.</p>
		<h4>Information Warranty Disclaimer</h4>
		<p>Notwithstanding anything else in this Policy, we are not responsible for the accuracy, correctness, and security of any of the information we gather, store, and disclose to you or to anyone else.</p>
		<p>Our policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent you disclose your information to other parties or sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Accordingly, we encourage you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party that you choose to disclose information to.</p>
		<h4>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h4>
		<p>We are in compliance with the requirements of COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), and we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age. Our website, products, and services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old or older. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your Children have provided us with personal information, please contact us. If We become aware that We have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>
		<h4>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h4>
		<p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page. The last revision will be reflected in the 'Last Updated' heading. Any changes to this policy will be posted on the Site. Your continued use of the Services following any such changes will be considered as your consent to the amended Privacy Policy.</p>
		<h4>How to Contact Us</h4>
		<p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or believe that Vidqu FaceSwap has not adhered to this Privacy Policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:support@vidqu.ai">support@vidqu.ai</a> and we will make efforts to promptly determine and remedy the problem.</p>
